# About me

🏠 I am currently improving myself as a Software Engineer in Europe (🇮🇹, 🇳🇱), focused on automation and data analysis in python, plus other stuff in C++ and Rust <p></p>

👟 Outside of my "nerd" and work momentum, I love traveling and adventures ✈️

🔖 Background (academic): B.Eng in Aerospace Engineering and M.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering (Technologies for eMobility), both at Politecnico di Torino (🇮🇹)

:fire:Background (non-academic): I was a football referee, worked as an intern in the aerospace field, and later in the automotive industry, eventually transitioning into the world of semiconductors as a Graduate Automotive Power Electronics Engineer and briefly to a position as Graduate Equipment Development Engineer.

# 🚀 Projects
I am currently working on a different range of projects from financial data analysis, project management trackers, servers communications to control systems.

### [Project Tracker](https://github.com/itsVinM/Python_Project_Tracker)

<p>
  Project tracker developed using Django and Plotly for "basic" tracking of 125+ projects
  
  - Dynamic table visualization enabled by [DataTables](https://datatables.net/index) and core information such as delay (S to R gate), project ID, name, and leader.
  - Gantt graph with "Overall", the sum of project gates (Project Management Institue's gates/definitions), latest baseline, and forecast by the project manager
  - Details of the project with the option for the PM to log in and update the information.
  - (ongoing) addition of KPIs, Capital Expenditure analysis, and other data analysis parameters
</p>

### [Bank Manage system](https://github.com/itsVinM/Bank_Manage)
<p>
   Basic CLI bank managing system.

   - code compiled with CMake
   - "Workflow" with build.yml file, and testing with Github's "Action"
</p>

### [Financial dashboard](https://github.com/itsVinM/FinancialDashboard)
<p>
  Simple stock analysis tool (ongoing)
</p> 
 
### [Vehicle control](https://github.com/itsVinM/Basic_vehicle_control)

### [Vehicle dynamics](https://github.com/itsVinM/Basic_vehicle_dynamics)

<p>
  "Basic" vehicle dynamics simulation, part of a bigger project in "Technologies for autonomous vehicles" (M.Eng. Mechatronics).
  Aim:
  
  - Analysis of different maneuvers given different steering inputs (step steer, ramp steer, and sweep sine), various positions of the Centre of Gravity, and values of speed. 
  
  - Use of a simplified Simulink lateral dynamic model reduced to a bicycle model, where the front and rear wheels are considered a single unit.

  - Conclusions of understeering, oversteering, or neutral positions. Further information was taken from the course "Automotive Control System" where the simulation was done in CarSim.
  
</p>

### [Current control for motor](https://github.com/itsVinM/Basic_Current_Control_Motor)

<p>
  "Basic" current control system for a three-phase motor simulated in Simulink with PID controller

  - Simulink model with mask, control system (with feedback), three-phase motor

  - Real motor data from various companies

  - PID control: open or close loop according to conditions.
